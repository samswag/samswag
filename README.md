Hi, 👋I’m Samson, a software developer who believes in changing the world. I’m an open source advocate, primarily maintaining <a href="https://github.com/sugarlabs"> Sugar Desktop </a>  while also serving on the board of directors with <a href="http://sugarlabs.org/">Sugar Labs </a>, and sustaining <a href="https://www.oscollective.org/"> Open Source Collective </a> as a board member. I also co-founded <a href="https://www.oscafrica.org/"> Open Source Community Africa </a>, a movement that promotes and educates everything open source within Africa 🌍. I’m currently consulting with the African Union, International Telecommunication Union, and UN Women to bring more women into technology. 🚀
