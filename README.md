# Samson Goddy -- OSS 🥑
Hi, 👋I’m Samson, a software developer who believes in changing the world. I’m an open source advocate, primarily maintaining [Sugar Desktop](https://github.com/sugarlabs) while also serving on the board of directors with [Sugar Labs](http://sugarlabs.org/), and sustaining  [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) as a board member. I also co-founded  [Open Source Community Africa](https://www.oscafrica.org), a movement that promotes and educates everything open source within Africa 🌍. I’m currently consulting with the African Union, International Telecommunication Union, and UN Women to bring more women into technology. 🚀



🌱 I’m currently playing with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

🔭 I’m currently working with scalable onboarding with the [Gnome project](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Engagement/initiatives/scalable-onboarding), [Sugar Desktop project](https://github.com/sugarlabs)
