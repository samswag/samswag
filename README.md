# Samson Goddy -- OSS 🥑
Hi, 👋I’m Samson, a software developer who believes in changing the world. I’m an open source advocate, primarily maintaining [Sugar Desktop](https://github.com/sugarlabs) while also serving on the board of directors with [Sugar Labs](http://sugarlabs.org/), and sustaining  [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) as a board member. I also co-founded  [Open Source Community Africa](https://www.oscafrica.org), a movement that promotes and educates everything open source within Africa 🌍. I’m currently consulting with the African Union, International Telecommunication Union, and UN Women to bring more women into technology. 🚀

## Mission
My mission in life isn't just to survive but to build something iconic. Maybe that is why I  lead things, sometimes convince people why somethings are very important. 

I believe in diverse skill sets and people as they make products and communities unique. 

## 🌱 I’m currently playing with: 

- Playing with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- Scalable onboarding with the [Gnome project](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Engagement/initiatives/scalable-onboarding)
- The [Sugar Desktop project](https://github.com/sugarlabs) got in into OSS, been giving back since 2011.
